## Data Preprocessing & Feature Engineering (`preprocessing.py`)

To ensure clean and modular code separation, the data engineering logic is isolated within `preprocessing.py`:
1. **Cleaning**: Column headers are stripped of surrounding whitespace, and features are filtered to the core underwriting variables.
2. **Imputation**: Missing values within feature lists are automatically replaced with their respective feature medians.
3. **Scaling**: Key inputs are normalized using `StandardScaler` to ensure optimal performance of distance-based estimators.
4. **Input Mapping**: Form values are converted into a pandas DataFrame dynamically with matching feature headers prior to inference to eliminate sklearn warnings.

## Machine Learning Pipeline (`train.py`)

Our training pipeline compared four standard classification models:
- **Logistic Regression**
- **Decision Tree**
- **Random Forest**
- **XGBoost**

### Target Class Balancing
The credit portfolio is heavily skewed with **25,007 Approved (Class 1)** profiles and only **121 Rejected (Class 0)** profiles. To counter this, `train.py` performs a stratified split (80/20) and **upsamples** the minority class in the training partition.

### Performance Results
Models are compared using the **Macro F1-Score** to prioritize minority class performance:

| Estimator | Accuracy | Precision (Approved) | Recall (Approved) | F1 (Approved) | Macro F1-Score |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| Logistic Regression | 99.20% | 100.00% | 99.20% | 99.60% | 0.7707 |
| Decision Tree | 99.28% | 99.98% | 99.30% | 99.64% | 0.7787 |
| Random Forest | 99.80% | 99.98% | 99.82% | 99.90% | 0.9102 |
| **XGBoost** | **99.96%** | **99.98%** | **99.98%** | **99.98%** | **0.9791** |

**XGBoost** was selected as the final classifier and serialized inside `model/model.pkl`.
